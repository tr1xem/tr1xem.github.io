Minimalism, in this sense, means designing systems that use the least hardware and software resources possible.\nWikipedia\nWorse is better\nIn The Rise of Worse is Better, Gabriel claimed that “Worse-is-Better” is a model of software design and implementation which has the following characteristics (in approximately descending order of importance):\n\nSimplicity. The design must be simple, both in implementation and interface. It is more important for the implementation to be simple than the interface. Simplicity is the most important consideration in a design.\nCorrectness. The design should be correct in all observable aspects, but It is slightly better to be simple than correct.\nConsistency. The design must not be overly inconsistent. Consistency can be sacrificed for simplicity in some cases, but it is better to drop those parts of the design that deal with less common circumstances than to introduce either complexity or inconsistency in the implementation.\nCompleteness. The design must cover as many important situations as is practical. All reasonably expected cases should be covered. Completeness can be sacrificed in favor of any other quality. In fact, completeness must be sacrificed whenever implementation simplicity is jeopardized. Consistency can be sacrificed to achieve completeness if simplicity is retained; especially worthless is consistency of interface.\n\nGabriel argued that early Unix and C, developed by Bell Labs, are examples of this design approach.\nWikipedia\nKISS (keep it simple, stupid)\nThe KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.\nWikipedia\nThe Suckless’ philosophy (manifest)\nMany (open source) hackers are proud if they achieve large amounts of code, because they believe the more lines of code they’ve written, the more progress they have made. The more progress they have made, the more skilled they are. This is simply a delusion.\nMost hackers actually don’t care much about code quality. Thus, if they get something working which seems to solve a problem, they stick with it. If this kind of software development is applied to the same source code throughout its entire life-cycle, we’re left with large amounts of code, a totally screwed code structure, and a flawed system design. This is because of a lack of conceptual clarity and integrity in the development process.\nCode complexity is the mother of bloated, hard to use, and totally inconsistent software. With complex code, problems are solved in suboptimal ways, valuable resources are endlessly tied up, performance slows to a halt, and vulnerabilities become a commonplace. The only solution is to scrap the entire project and rewrite it from scratch.\nThe bad news: quality rewrites rarely happen, because hackers are proud of large amounts of code. They think they understand the complexity in the code, thus there’s no need to rewrite it. They think of themselves as masterminds, understanding what others can never hope to grasp. To these types, complex software is the ideal.\nIngenious ideas are simple. Ingenious software is simple. Simplicity is the heart of the Unix philosophy. The more code lines you have removed, the more progress you have made. As the number of lines of code in your software shrinks, the more skilled you have become and the less your software sucks.\nWebsite\nThe Unix philosophy\nThe Unix philosophy, originated by Ken Thompson, is a set of cultural norms and philosophical approaches to minimalist, modular software development.\nThe Unix philosophy emphasizes building simple, short, clear, modular, and extensible code that can be easily maintained and repurposed by developers other than its creators. The Unix philosophy favors composability as opposed to monolithic design.\n\nUNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity.\n\n\n– Dennis Ritchie\n\nWikipedia\nDRY (don’t repeat yourself)\n\nEvery piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.\n\nWikipedia\nYAGNI (you aren’t gonna need it)\n\nAlways implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.\n\nWikipedia\nCoding Style\nAs clean as possible.

This is (little bit)  inspired by Primagen’s Course.\nTL;DR: Here is my dotfiles repo: Link\nDotfiles management\nWhat are dotfiles? Well dotfiles are&nbsp;hidden configuration files on Unix-based systems, such as Linux and macOS, that store settings, preferences, and configurations for various applications, tools, and the system environment. So that means if you can transfer your dotfiles from one device to another device, your whole configuration (including themes) should stay the same.\nFor dotfiles management, I use GNU Stow it just does a simple thing, it would create symlink of files to their actual directories. For example, I have stored my .config inside ~/dotfiles/config/.config (dotfiles is a git repo btw) what stow does is that it takes files ~/dotfiles/config/.config from there and symlinks it to their actually location i.e. ~/.config/ so when ever I update a config it is always stored in ~/dotfiles which being a git repo gives me ability to back up my whole folder on GitHub.\nI recommend you watching the following video if you want to learn more about stow\n\n\nHere is my dotfiles repo: Link\nWhy use a Tilling Window Manager?\n\n\nFlux\n\nA&nbsp;desktop&nbsp;environment is&nbsp;a graphical user interface (GUI) that runs on top of an operating system, providing users with a visually intuitive way to interact with the system.\nI prefer tilling window manager, Why? Because they remove the overhead of managing windows from me, and generally it’s keyboard driven and as you know the more you can remove the need for a mouse the more productive and smooth your workflow gets.\nI use Hyprland, why? Because firstly it’s a tilling WM, and secondly it has awesome customization and looks (I love blur btw) but any tilling wm of your choice would suffice. And no I don’t care about Wayland vs Xorg, I have used sway,i3,DWM in the past, and it’s just I want a good-looking desktop (as you can see in banner). Talking about the photo, it’s my own shell that’s called Flux, which is made in Ignis. It’s just suited according to my preference, but yeah it looks good (specially the depth effect). If you are a new user, I would recommend you reading the Hyprland’s Wiki as it’s simple and straight forward (and looks good)\nWhat do I look in a shell?\nIt could be also said as why I made flux, I have a 15.6 inch display(which is quite average) and to maximise the use of all space available on my screen I need a bar which is small but still shows important things. Also, I don’t like the idea of having a bottom bar imagine the closest thing to you is a bar staring at you also it gives windows like feel to me. Besides, It has all network and miscellaneous controls built in, so I don’t need any external app to manage all of this.\nTools\nNow I will list down the tools I use on a daily basis.(all the configs related to them are in my dotfiles repo)\nEditor: Why Neovim?\n\n\nNeovim\n\nI personally use Neovim because it’s vim (and vim movements) and on top of it, it’s highly customizable with a lot of plugins.\nIf you ask me, what’s one thing that made my dev experience 100x better? It’s learning Vim movements, and aside from the productivity parts, it actually makes the code writing an enjoyable experience. It might be a bit overwhelming to learn vim movements at first but trust me on this one it’s 100% worth it. To learn, I would suggest watching this playlist Vim as your editor by theprimagen.\nTerminal Multiplexer: Why Tmux?\n\n\nTmux\n\nA terminal multiplexer is&nbsp;a software application that allows multiple pseudoterminal-based login sessions to be multiplexed within a single terminal display, terminal emulator window, or remote login session.\nBasically, it lets you create more than one non-volatile (sessions would not stop if terminal is killed). You would be thinking, why not just use diff window? Well, yeah you can, but what if u need nine windows simultaneously? That’s where tmux comes in, you can have as many shell (or windows) as you like while still being in one terminal. Another use case it like if you are ssh’d into a VPS what if u need more than one shell you have to ssh from a diff terminal window but if u use tmux only one ssh login can do it, and also it could run in background so u won’t need something like screen. Also, you can split panes and do things like re-ordering and making more sessions, which made it a core part of my workflow. If you want to learn more about tmux Dreams of Code have a great video on it.\nAI Assistance: Opencode and Supermaven\n\n\nOpencode\n\nPersonally, I don’t like using AI in development side, as I don’t think we are at that stage where AI could write a dependable piece of code. Neither do I like nor support the idea of Vibe Coding. But on other time like for creating a generic bash script or finding out grammatical mistakes I think Opencode is best, It’s open source, the developer is super friendly, and it’s not model bound that means you can use any model even bring your own local LLM.\nI personally don’t like the idea of AI inside your editor like one half of your editor is full of prompts and things like this, I prefer an outside of editor and terminal based agent so I could just use tmux to create a window for it. It’s just my preference of keeping editor and agents different, and I guess most of the people have the same?(unless they are vibe coding?)\nThe thing I like inside my editor is AI based autocomplete, it comes in handy in most of the place. I personally use Supermaven because it’s fast, free and correct(most of the time) and also they got a Neovim plugin that’s why too.\nTerminal: Ghostty\nI don’t really care about it, I just use Ghostty. I don’t think it creates any difference, they are all the same.\nHyprscrolling\n\n\n\nScrolling Layout\n\nI use Hyprscrolling plugin to add features of a scrolling window manager to Hyprland. It’s been a month since I started using it and it’s great. But it totally depends on preferences, I just happen to like it.\nContainer based development\nNow this I learnt recently, and it’s already a core part of my workflow\nIf you use Systemd it comes with Systemd-nspawn which technically creates a minimal Linux distribution (headless) which I would say is like an isolated part of your distro. It’s like the chroot command, but it is a chroot on steroids. By using containers, I can keep the host system minimal while maintaining separate, well-organized environments for different tasks. If you want to know more about this, you can refer to Gaspar’s blog on how he manages his devlopment containers.(shout out to him as he taught me this too)\nHornable mentions: Non Development tools\n\nFFmpeg - the greatest tool that have ever lived\nTealdeer - Man pages are too long\nCppman - All CPP man pages offline\nCurd - I use it every time I want to watch anime, truly the best.\nVicinae - Raycast for linux just try it\n\nConclusion\nIf you asked me what are the top two things you should adopt from this, I would say learning vim movements (just movements, not Neovim) and tmux, they alone would make a massive addition in your workflow.\nIf you got any suggestions or tools that you use everyday, let me know, maybe I could use them as well??\nAnd my setup could be not better than yours (or it could be) but it surely is perfect for me 😉\n","id":"https://trix.is-a.dev/blog/my-dev-setup-is-better-than-yours/","title":"My dev setup is better than yours"},"https://trix.is-a.dev/blog/website-rewrite-in-zola/":{"body":"Backstory\nWho dosent need a website? so a year ago I thought I’d create a website for myself, and I did. But guess what? it was in pure HTML and CSS (prolly from some github) repo.\nBut i really felt a need to have a better looking website, in which i could showcase my projects, and maybe even write a blog.\nSo a frnd of mine Gasper(a very cool guy) suggested me to use Hugo and i was like “wts hugo?”.\nI did watched a pretty good,crisp and short video on how to use it and i was like “okay, i’ll give it a try”.\n\n\n^ the goat video for hugo in my opinion.\nand it turned out like this\n\n\nOld Website\n\nI know its shit (sometime i even surprise myself with the results 🤡), but i was like “its the most my superior brain could do”. also im not at all motivated to do frontend and styling.\nEntry of Zola\nI was reading Gradience Autopsy: Rise and Set - Daudix (all love to gradience forever)  and the looks caught my eye. and then i got to know about Zola. Zola to me is like hugo(XD idk how correct im)\nand with it i came to know about a guy named Daudix and his theme for zola named Ametrine tho acc to him its not stable but as I being a arch user do not care about\nstable things at all.\nAmetrine is the greatest theme i have ever seen, its so simple to use and the result you are seeing it here, ofc i did copypasta from Daudix’s website too but yeah thats what open source is and as someone said already\n\n“Original content is original only for a few seconds before getting old”\n~Rule 69 of internet\n\nSo if u you want to make a website and ur not some geeky frontend wizard, i suggest u to use zola and ametrine.\nSome Crazy Featuers and Styling\nI love how it renders tables\nPageRepo\nHomepages\nInfopages\nWorkspages\nBlogblog-source\n\nand code blocks\n\nand these github like alerts\n\nUseful information that users should know, even when skimming content.\n\n\nHelpful advice for doing things better or more easily.\n\n\nKey information users need to know to achieve their goal.\n\n\nUrgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.\n\n\nAdvises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.\n\nButtons are good too\nDo Something…\nExample\nand many more check it out yourself at Ametrine’s website\nConclusion\nIt’s been an interesting journey for sure; trying to use Hugo, losing my mind, regretting life choices,\nlearning wierd stuff and using my 1 brain cell to think about how tf do i make it look good, burning out, coming back, learning more weird thing, procrastinating, coming back, rewriting half of the styles, and finally\nfinding out i had no need for it (it hurts a bit 😭). But yep i guess now this would be my main website for a long time : )\nGald i found Ametrine and Daudix\n","id":"https://trix.is-a.dev/blog/website-rewrite-in-zola/","title":"Website Rewrite in Zola"},"https://trix.is-a.dev/messageboard/":{"body":"","id":"https://trix.is-a.dev/messageboard/","title":"Message Board"},"https://trix.is-a.dev/nanolog/":{"body":"","id":"https://trix.is-a.dev/nanolog/","title":"Nanolog"},"https://trix.is-a.dev/nanolog/adding-new-stuff/":{"body":"Just added ntfy (made a client in go for desktop so i get notification) and the animated title daudix helped me :&gt;\n","id":"https://trix.is-a.dev/nanolog/adding-new-stuff/","title":"adding new stuff"},"https://trix.is-a.dev/nanolog/anime-section/":{"body":"Added a anime section to the home page, its fetching anime data from anilist.co and filtering out the top anime of the user.\nPretty happy with it :)\n","id":"https://trix.is-a.dev/nanolog/anime-section/","title":"Adding Anime Section"},"https://trix.is-a.dev/nanolog/did-more-than-expected/":{"body":"Did more than expected, and it’s looking good so far.\n","id":"https://trix.is-a.dev/nanolog/did-more-than-expected/","title":"Website Creation"},"https://trix.is-a.dev/nanolog/finally-setup-ci/":{"body":"Just setup the ci now all blogs can be autoposted ; ) was fun learning how to do it.
